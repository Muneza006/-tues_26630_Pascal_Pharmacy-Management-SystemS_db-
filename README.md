🧠 Introduction
Modern pharmacies face increasing challenges due to manual processes that often result in prescription errors, inventory mismatches, delayed patient services, and data inconsistencies. 
To address these pain points, this project introduces a Pharmacy Management System built using Oracle Database and PL/SQL programming. The system provides automation, real-time tracking, and secure data management for prescriptions, inventory, and payments—enhancing service delivery and operational efficiency.

The project was implemented in eight phases, covering everything from problem analysis and business modeling to logical design, implementation, testing, and reporting.

🎯 Phase 1: Problem Statement

🧩 Problem Definition

Pharmacies often face operational inefficiencies due to manual handling of prescriptions, outdated inventory tracking methods, and unstructured patient records. These issues contribute to:

Medication errors and mismatched prescriptions

Delays in service

Out-of-stock problems

Lost revenue due to poor billing and payment tracking

🧪 Context

This Pharmacy Management System is designed for community and hospital-based pharmacies where data integrity, automation, and quick access to patient information are critical.

👥 Target Users

Pharmacists – Manage inventory, fulfill prescriptions

Doctors – Issue prescriptions

Patients – Get medication, view history

Managers – View analytics, track performance

🎯 Project Goals

Automate prescription workflows

Track inventory levels and alert on low stock


🛠️ Phase 2: Business Process Modeling (BPM)
📌 Objectives
This phase models the end-to-end operations of a pharmacy—from prescription handling to billing. Using BPMN diagrams, the key workflows are broken down for clarity and automation.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Actors
Doctor: Issues a prescription

Patient: Receives prescription and requests medication

Pharmacist: Reviews prescription and dispenses medicine

System: Manages stock levels, alerts, and payment status

🔁 Key Workflows
Prescription Issuance: Doctor prescribes medicine to patient.

Prescription Validation: Pharmacist verifies the prescription.

Stock Check: System checks availability.

Dispensing & Billing: Medication is issued and payment processed.

Inventory Update: System updates stock levels automatically.

Maintain secure patient prescription records

Integrate payment management and reporting
